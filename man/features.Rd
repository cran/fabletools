\title{Extract features from a dataset}
\usage{
features(.tbl, .var, features, ...)

features_at(.tbl, .vars, features, ...)

features_all(.tbl, features, ...)

features_if(.tbl, .predicate, features, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.tbl}{A dataset}

\item{.var, .vars}{The variable(s) to compute features on}

\item{features}{A list of functions (or lambda expressions) for the features to compute. \code{\link[=feature_set]{feature_set()}} is a useful helper for building sets of features.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to each feature. These arguments will only be passed to features which use it in their formal arguments (\code{\link[base:formals]{base::formals()}}), and not via their \code{...}. While passing \code{na.rm = TRUE} to \code{\link[stats:cor]{stats::var()}} will work, it will not for \code{\link[base:mean]{base::mean()}} as its formals are \code{x} and \code{...}. To more precisely pass inputs to each function, you can use lambdas in the list of features (\code{~ mean(., na.rm = TRUE)}).}

\item{.predicate}{A predicate function (or lambda expression) to be applied to the columns or a logical vector. The variables for which .predicate is or returns TRUE are selected.}
}
\description{
Create scalar valued summary features for a dataset from feature functions.

Lists of available features can be found in the following pages:
\itemize{
\item \link[=features_by_pkg]{Features by package}
\item \link[=features_by_tag]{Features by tag}
